## Installation
First, you have to run the schema.sql and seed.sql code in your SQL server so you have the necessary database and tables. You will then need to go into your downloaded version and input your SQL password into the connection.js file. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

To install the node packages, use the command below:

` $ npm i `


## Usage 
Note that everything will show in your terminal, so make sure you have a large screen so you can see everything without too much trouble. 

To run the package after you've installed it, run the command below:

` $ node index.js`


## Credits
This package uses node.js and inquirer. I also pulled license and code badges from GitHub.
